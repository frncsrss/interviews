## Code related to technical interview questions
------------------------------------------------
Each package corresponds to the underlying data structure or problem of a technical interview question.

### Disclaimer
--------------
All the code is my answer to the question and it should not be taken as granted. Technical interviews are about discussion and refinements of a first brute force yet well-implemented solution. There may be some better way to implement the solution(s).

### Highlights
--------------
*	Range Minimum Query (using a sparse table)
*	Left-leaning Red-Black Tree
*	Max, Power, Sum
*	Union-Find (with path compression)
*	Shellsort
*	Pattern matching (Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm)

### Misc
--------
Take a look at the tests to get a better idea on how to use the methods. I tried to comment whenever there were some tricks involved.
